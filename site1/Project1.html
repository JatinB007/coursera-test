    <p style="color:black"><b>Village cricket had developed by the middle of the 17th century and the first English “county teams” were formed in the second half of the century, as “local experts” from village cricket were employed as the earliest professionals. The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709. Having originated in south-east England, it became the country's national sport in the 18th century and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since 1844 and Test cricket began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877</b></p>
  </section>
  <section id="Formats of Cricket">
    <h2><p style="color:grey"><u><i><b>Formats of Cricket</b></i></u></p></h2>
    <p style="color:black"><b>There are three formats of cricket played at the international level – Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. These matches are played under the rules and regulations approved by the International Cricket Council, which also provides match officials for them.</b></p>
    <h2><p style="color:black"><b>1. Test Cricket</b></p></h2>
<center>
  <img src="Test.jpg" width="300" height="300" ></center>
<p style="color:black"><b>Test cricket is the traditional form of the game, which has been played since 1877 and now settled in a five-day format which comprises two innings each. It is considered the pinnacle form because it tests teams over a longer period of time. Teams need to exhibit endurance, technique and temperament in different conditions to do well in this format.

The leader of the MRF Tyres ICC Test Match rankings (as on 1 April each year) gets a cash prize of $1 million, with the next three teams in the rankings also getting cash awards.</b></p><br>

<h2><p style="color:black">2. ODI Cricket</p></h2>

<p style="color: black"><b>One Day Internationals, also known as ODIs, are a pacier format which started in 1971 but gained in popularity from the 1980s. These are one-innings matches of 50 overs per side, in which teams with a blend of technique, speed and skill are expected to do well. The ICC’s pinnacle event, the ICC Cricket World Cup, is contested every four years in this format.

The 50-over format has developed in more recent years with the ICC also organising the Champions Trophy for the top eight ranked teams, the ICC Women’s World Cup every four years and the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup every two years.</b></p><br>

<p style="color: black"><b>Twenty20 Internationals are the newest, shortest and fastest form of the game. This format of 20 overs per side has brought in new audiences since its advent in 2005 and also triggered new skill sets and innovations. A Twenty20 International match is usually competed in three hours and with huge hitting, skillful bowling and amazing fielding it has been hugely popular with fans right around the world.</b></p><br>

    <p style="color: black"><b>The International Cricket Council (ICC) was founded at Lord's on 15 June 1909 as the Imperial Cricket Conference, with Australia, England, and South Africa as its founding members. In the beginning, only countries within the Commonwealth could join. These members were then joined by India, New Zealand, and the West Indies in 1926 and later by Pakistan in 1953. In 1961, South Africa resigned due to their leaving the Commonwealth, but they continued to play Test cricket until their international exile in 1970.<br><br>

The Imperial Cricket Conference was renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, with new rules permitting countries from outside the Commonwealth to be elected into the governing body for the first time. That year, Fiji and the USA became the first Associate Member nations.<br><br>

In 1981, Sri Lanka became the first Associate Member to be elected a Full Member, returning the number of Test-playing nations to seven. In 1989, the ICC was again renamed, this time to International Cricket Council. South Africa was reelected as a Full Member to the ICC in 1991 and Zimbabwe was elected in 1992. It would be eight years before the next Full Member, Bangladesh, was elected in 2000. On 22 June 2017, Ireland and Afghanistan were granted Full Member and Test status, bringing the number of Full Members to 12.<br><br>

As of January 2020, there are 104 ICC members, with 12 Full Members and 92 Associate Members. The Membership Committee will consider all future requests for membership – full and associate – against an objective set of criteria. There was previously a third level, Affiliate Membership, which was removed in June 2017 with all previous Affiliate Members becoming Associate Members. The rule changes introduced a hierarchy, with two categories of membership: Full Members and Associate Members. Any new member elected to the governing body could only be an Associate Member, with the possibility of later being promoted to a Full Member based on ongoing performance in international competition.<br><br>

In July 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket, the first time this has been done to a Full Member side. In October 2019, the ICC lifted its suspension on Zimbabwe Cricket.</b></p><br>

    <p style="color: black"><b>Donald Bradman is actually titled Sir for his achievements as a player and especially batsman. His nickname is The Don. He is considered from most of the sports experts for being the best batsman in the history of cricket. What gave him this respect is the fact that his batting average is 99.94, which is stunning indeed. There is even a term in his honour – Bradmanesque, which implies something of great excellence.<br><br>

Bradman first played for small local teams. He started as a bush cricketer, but it took him only two years to raise his competences and start playing in the Australian Test team. To the age of 22, he had already set some records for top-scoring and soon turned out to be among the famous cricketers and an Australian sports idol. Bradman has a long 20-year playing career and due to his great talent has shown others that nothing is impossible if you have the heart to play and to the will to be the best.<br><br>

Although Sachin Tendulkar is already a former cricket player, he is rated among the greatest. He was the captain of the Indian national team and is classified as the highest run-scorer of all time. Widely recognised as perfect batsmen, he started to play cricket at the age of eleven. In addition, Tendulkar is also recognised to be the only cricketer who has scored one hundred international centuries. In 1994 he received a special award from the Indian government for his contribution to sports. Then, another great award followed in 1997 – the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, which is the biggest India’s sporting honour.<br><br>

Several other awards followed in 1999 and 2008 that stiffened his positions among the most reputable cricketers. In addition, the Time magazine included his him the annual Time 100 top-ranked influential people in the world for 2010. After his long sports career full of great achievements, wonderful playing performance and many awards, Tendulkar announced his retirement from the sport in December 2012. His great style of cross-dominant playing that included bats, bowls and throws is what made him an idol for many cricket lovers around the world.<br><br>

His name stayed in the history of the sport for being widely acknowledged as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He was on top of several rank lists. Lara also holds the record for highest individual score in first-class cricket. Another achievement, thanks to which he climbed up on the ladder of most respected ones, is his record for the highest individual score in a Test innings. Also, he succeeded to make 153 not outs against Australia in 1999, for which he gained the reputation for being the second-best batsman in the history of Test cricket right after Donald Bradman.<br><br>

Brian Lara started his cricket career at a very early age. However, his breakthrough was in 1987 during the West Indies Youth Championship. Then he scored the amazing 498 runs and broke the previous record of 480. Soon after, in 1988 his first-class debut followed. The left-handed batsman’s nickname is “The Prince”.</b><br><br></p>
